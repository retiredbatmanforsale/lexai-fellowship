    "We are looking at how to compute the derivatives of the **cost function** for linear regression. The cost function is:\n",

    "\n",
    "We are trying to **minimize** the total error between our predicted line $\\hat{y}_i = mx_i + c$ and the actual data $y_i$. The total error is the **sum of squared differences** (residuals).\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we want to find values of $m$ (slope) and $c$ (intercept) such that this error is the smallest. In math, we do this by computing the **derivatives**—which tell us the direction in which the function is increasing or decreasing.\n",

    "### Derivative Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are walking on a hilly surface (the graph of the function). The **derivative** tells you the slope of the hill at your feet. If the slope is steeply upwards, go the other way! If it's steeply downwards, keep going—it means you're minimizing the function.\n",
