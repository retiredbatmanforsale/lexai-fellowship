    "# Understanding Convolution Through Dice Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Understanding convolution through the two-dice probability example is a beautiful way to build intuition, especially for convolution in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Let's walk through this step-by-step.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Setup: Sum of Two Dice 🎲\n",
    "\n",
    "You're rolling two fair 6-sided dice (Die A and Die B). Each die has numbers from 1 to 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to calculate the probability distribution of their sum:\n",
    "- Minimum sum = 1 + 1 = 2\n",
    "- Maximum sum = 6 + 6 = 12\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to know the probability of each sum from 2 to 12.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Represent Each Die as a Probability Vector 🔢\n",
    "\n",
    "Since each die is fair, each die has a discrete uniform distribution over values 1 to 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we can represent the probability of each outcome as a vector:\n",
    "\n",
    "Die A (and Die B) probabilities:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Index:      0     1     2     3     4     5\n",
    "Face:       1     2     3     4     5     6\n",
    "P(value):  1/6   1/6   1/6   1/6   1/6   1/6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's define this as a vector a:\n",
    "```\n",
    "a = [1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Same for the second die b.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: What is Convolution? 🔁\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of convolution as a simple algebric operation and not a complex phenomenon. The convolution operation combines these two vectors to produce a new vector c such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "c[n] = ∑ a[k] * b[n - k]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is summing over all the ways to combine values from Die A and Die B to get a total sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "But since this is discrete and finite, we do discrete convolution of two sequences a and b:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "c = a * b  ← (discrete convolution)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With respect to our above example, This c gives us probabilities for each possible sum ```c = [P(sum = 2), ... P(sum=12)]```. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Intuition: What Does Convolution Do? 🧠\n",
    "\n",
    "When you convolve two probability distributions (like the two dice), the result is a distribution of their sum. That is exactly what we want. At its core, convolution is an operation defined between two functions whether discrete or continous(or sequences), where you slide one function over another, multiply their overlapping values, and sum the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "This operation is not any arbitrary function, it has strong structure and meaning in:\n",
    "- Signal processing (filtering, smoothing)\n",
    "- Probability (distribution of sums)\n",
    "- Deep learning (feature extraction)\n",
    "- Differential equations\n",
    "- Image processing\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4: Match It to CNN Convolution 🔁\n",
    "\n",
    "In CNNs, you are convolving a filter (kernel) with the input (like an image patch).\n",
    "\n",
    "Dice example:\n",
    "- a = input distribution (Die A)\n",
    "- b = filter (Die B)\n",
    "- a * b = convolved output (sum distribution)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly what CNN does, except:\n",
    "- In images: the input is a 2D grid of pixel values\n",
    "- The kernel is usually a small 2D filter (e.g., 3x3)\n",
    "- The convolution aggregates local neighborhoods (just like dice values aggregate sum probabilities)\n",
    "\n",
    "So convolution in CNNs generalizes this same \"overlapping and summing\" idea across image regions.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Compute the Convolution: c = a * b 🔁\n",
    "\n",
    "The convolution c[n] = ∑ a[k] * b[n-k] computes the probability of each sum from 2 to 12, just like before.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting vector c will have size:\n",
